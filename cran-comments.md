## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed an error that hindered the ``compare_E`` function when the species to be compared were characterised by inequal amounts of Te values.

## test environments
* local OS Windows 10 64-bit install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* There was a message about possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION (ectotemp  at 6:127).

That word is spelled correctly.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies.
