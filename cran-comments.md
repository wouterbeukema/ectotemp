## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated ectotemp to R 4.0

## test environments
* local OS Windows 10 86-bit install, R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* There was a message about possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION (ectotemp  at 6:127).

That word is spelled correctly.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies.
